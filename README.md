This project implements a pathfinding visualization for a robot nurse in a hospital environment using Python and Tkinter. The program allows you to visualize different pathfinding algorithms (A* and Dijkstra's) as the robot navigates to patient requests with varying priorities.

## ✨ Features
- **Dual Algorithm Support**:
  - 🚀 A* with Manhattan distance heuristic
  - ⚖️ Dijkstra's priority-based approach
- **Priority Management**:
  - 🎨 Color-coded priorities (1=blue → 5=red)
  - 🔢 Processes highest-priority requests first
- **Visualization**:
  - 🖥️ Interactive Tkinter GUI
  - 🎬 Animated path drawing
  - ⚫ Obstacle detection
